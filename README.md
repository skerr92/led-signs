# Create Custom LED Signs!

Welcome to my custom LED signs project! This project is designed to help people get into electronics and introduced with simple circuit design.

Included in this repository is a wealth of resources to get started. There are some basic circuit diagrams, Eagle board designs for simple signs, and starter code with sign animations.

Over time, more designs and resources will be added to the project to be used as you pleased for <b>Personal Use Only</b>. We would love for other users to add on to this project and create new ways for new users to explore circuit design and electronics.

# How to get started

<ol>
  <li>Checkout the Circuit Diagrams</li>
  <li>Download the Eagle Files</li>
  <li>customize as you see fit</li>
</ol>

# Checkout the Circuit Diagrams

Before getting started, it is important to get an understanding of the basic circuit that is used to drive the basic designs presented in this repository.
This understanding will help you determine what is necessary to make these circuits work. I would suggest getting familiar with Ohm's Law, principles of diodes, characteristics of capacitors, and current gain relationship of transistors. These concepts are fundamental for the operation of these LED arrays.

You can go to websites like <a href="https://circuitlab.com">circuitlab</a> to build circuits and get acquainted with modeling circuits and simulating them as well.

# Download the Eagle Files

Downloading the eagle files will allow you to open the project in Autodesk Eagle which comes with Fusion360.

You can get a hobbyist 1 year trial of <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/fusion-360-for-hobbyists">Eagle Here!</a>

In eagle you can open the schematics and board designs to see the layout.

# Customize as you see fit

After you get used to working with the circuits provided with this project, customize them to what you need! Design additional letters, or make cool shapes! The only limitation is your imagination! (and your board size, but you can always get a bunch of boards to put together!)
